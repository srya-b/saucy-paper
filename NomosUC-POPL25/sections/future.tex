This work introduced a novel abstraction of import session types by adapting binary session types to the UC setting.
The decision was motivated, in part, by Nomos~\cite{das2018work, dasnomos} whose resource-aware binary session types
fit nicely into the import mechanism in UC.
Resource-aware session types in Nomos come with an implementation of their powerful type system and a linear-time checker,
so, while this work is only on paper, implementing NomosUC type system is a natural next step.

We also want to expand our encoding of UC in NomosUC by expressing synchronous and asynchronous models of communication and computation. 
Specifically, creating programming conventions and models around the NomosUC to express such models.
Furthermore, we want to add better tooling around our UC definitions such as automated property-based
or model-based testing of functionality/protocol specifications and fuzz testing. 
Tooling like this around NomosUC makes a stronger case for it as a practical language for implementing cryptographic/distributed protocols.
