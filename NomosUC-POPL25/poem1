it's hard to write jokes when you want
you always hope it'll be a pleasant jaunt
but the ideas come when you least expect it
sometimes at work or a bar, or sometimes when taking a shit

it's the funniest thought you've had today 
surely the idea can never go away
my mind's astute 
my memory's acute 
and my work is done for the day

wow that was a good idea, I didn't even have to strain
how fucking great am I
wait... how did the joke end again?
