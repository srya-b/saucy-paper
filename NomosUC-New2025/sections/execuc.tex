So far we have covered how import session types can describe communication
protocols and allow processes to exchange runtime through import tokens.  In
this section, we apply our definitions to realizing UC, and elaborate on how we
support the dynamic creation of functionalities and parties, and we We propose
a new construction called \emph{providerless channels} to over a limitation of
linear channels that prevents cyclical topologies of processes.  Providerless
channels were introduced and used in the code of \simcom in Figure
\ref{fig:simcom} (\todo{which lines?}) to create channels for \Fro.  These
channels can be thought of syntactic sugar over the design we describe in this
section.  Not only do they allow cyclical topologies, but they are instrumental
in allowing NomosUC to support dynamic creation of functionalities and
protocols.  Finally, at the end of the section we describe the UC composition
operator in NomosUC.
\todo{We might limit to just the single comp depending on space}

%So far we have introduced a type system and process calculus for writing and checking runtime that conforms to the import mechanism for polynomial time.
%In this section, we show how NomosUC processes overcome a limitation of binary session types to realize any arbitrary configuration of ITMs, and describe how \emph{providerless channels} and sandboxing enable an arbitrary number of protocol parties. 
%Next, we realize the Dummy Lemma (sometimes described as completeness of the dummy adversary~\cite{gnuc}), an important result in used as a standard result intended to show the expressiveness of new UC programming tools or formulations~\cite{ilc,easyuc,gnuc}.
%Despite the machinery required to realize import, our approach yields a surprisingly simple simulator proof.
%Finally, we realize UC composition by first realizing a simpler composition operator~\cite{ilc}, a multisession theorem with join state~\cite{symbolicuc,juc}, and combine them in a natural way to state the full composition theorem in NomosUC.

\subsection{Capturing the UC Computation Model}
%A limitation of binary session types is the communication topologies that they can realize.
%When a linear channel is created, it is offered by a process called the ``provider'' and given to a process called the ``client'', and this imposes a strict parent-child relationship between processes.
Linear channels are created when a process, called the ``client'', spawns a
process called the ``provider'' that creates and offers (i.e. returns) the
channel.  The parent-child relationship this creates, prevents cyclical
topologies using only linear channels like the one in Figure \ref{fig:pandq}.
Here, $P$ takes $Q$'s channel as input and $Q$ takes $P$'s channel as input,
but one must be spawned before the other making this topology unrealizable.

We overcome this limitation by using shared session types to create a new
abstract channel called a \emph{providerless channel}.  Providerless channels
are built from processes that use shared channels, but offer linear channels at
both ends to $P$ and $Q$.  Shared channels interrupt cyclical topologies by
allowing multiple concurrent clients that acquire the channel via a locking
mechanism.  Using only shared channels throughout NomosUC is an inviting
prospect, but we show below that they constrain message types.  In the
remainder of the paper, we will use pchannels to refer to providerless
channels, for brevity.

The first piece of the construction is the communicator: a message buffer
offering a shared channel where multiple parties can read from and write to.
It's type, given below, $\up$ indicates a party must \emph{acquire} it, and
potentially wait for another process to \emph{release} ($\down$), before
checking for new messages with \mb{poll} or put a new message in with \mb{push}
if it is empty.  The type of the messages written and read are constrained by
the parameter $\tau$, and the number of import sent across it by the parameter
$n$.  The message type in this case can only be a functional message type.  We
can not allow $\tau$ to be a sessiom type itself because allowing channels to
be sent over other channels introduces behavior prohibited by the UC framework.
Refer to Appendix \ref{app:typing_rules} for the full typing rules of shared
session types.

%The process configuration in Figure~\ref{fig:pandq}, for example, is not realizable with just linear channels, because of the following circular dependency: 
%Finally, we cover a simplified composition theorem (Theorem~\ref{thm:singlecomp}, in detail and show how it is extended to full UC composition.
%$P$ must already exist in order for $Q$ to be given its channel, but $Q$ must first exist in order for $P$ to be spawed with $Q$s channel.
%We overcome this limitation by using shared session types to create a new abstract channel called a \emph{providerless channel}.
%Shared channels allow us to define a message buffer called a communictor, that allows multiple other processes act as its clients and use its channel to send messages.
%Any process can attempt to \emph{acquire} its channel, check for new messages with \mb{poll}, and place another message in the bugger with \m{push} (similar to shared memory accessed via a lock).
%The session type of the communicator is given below, along with operators to acquire ($\up$) and release ($\down$) operators, below, and the full typing rules of shared session types is given in Appendix~\ref{app:typing_rules}.
%We provide the full typing rule of shared session types and the communicator in the Appendix.

The diagram in Figure \ref{fig:newpandq} outlines the full construction of a pchannel realizing the $P$ and $Q$ previously unrealizable by linear channels alone.
The main idea is to convert between session types and functional message types, in each direction, by using dummy parties \m{a_P}, \m{a_Q}, \m{b_P}, and \m{b_Q} which communicate via session types and pass a functionally typed message to the communicator.
The communicator passes the message to the dummy party at the other end that's waiting to acquire the channel, read the message and send the appropriate label along its offered session-typed channel to the receving party. 
Note that in this figure, $P$ and $Q$ are connected by \emph{two} pchannels. 
Processes in NomosUC, can be connected together by arbitrarily many channels.

Handling communication through pchannels allows NomosUC to make meaningful use of session types while still overcoming the topology limitation.
Additionally, the code for the dummy processes in the channel can be trivially generated (as switch statements) given the session type and its analogous functional type.

\paragraph{Realizing a pchannel.}
Imagine a process $M$ that wants to create the topology with $P$ and $Q$ in Figure \ref{fig:pandq} and communicate with then itself--effectively created a triangle topology.
Call the session types between the three parties \m{PQ}, \m{PM}, and \m{QM}, and call their functional counterparts \m{fPQ}, \m{fPM}, and \m{fQM}.
For communication between $P$ and $Q$, the first process spawned is the communicator parameterized by type \m{fPQ}.
The dummy party offering a channel to $P$, from $Q$, takes the shared channel offered by the communicator as a parmeter and has type:
\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\scriptsize\BeraMonottFamily, mathescape, frame=single, numbers=left, xleftmargin=2em, xrightmargin=0.9em]
$\nproc$ convertp2q: (k: Int), (rng: [Bit]), (sid: someSID), 
   (#c: comm[fPQ])  $\vdash$ ($\$$ch: PQ)
\end{lstlisting}
If the session type specifies that $P$ writes a message first, it first waits to receive a message over its offered channel of type \m{PQ}, otherwise it runs in a loop waiting to consume a message from the communicator. 
The converter runs in a loop, reading messages from one side and sending the corresponding message on the other side via a big swtich statement. 
The pchannel syntax returns two linear channels, \m{PQforp} for $P$ and \m{PQforq} for $Q$, and it is sugar for the following real process code:
\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\scriptsize\BeraMonottFamily, mathescape, frame=single, numbers=left, xleftmargin=2em, xrightmargin=0.9em]
#c $\leftarrow$ communicatorp2q $\leftarrow$ k rng
$\$$PQforq $\leftarrow$ convertp2q $\leftarrow$ #c
$\$$PQforp $\leftarrow$ convertq2p $\leftarrow$ #c
\end{lstlisting}
Analogous linear channels are create for communication with $M$ (\m{MPforp} and \m{MPform})
The type of process $P$ accepts two linear channels for communication as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\scriptsize\BeraMonottFamily, mathescape, frame=single, numbers=left, xleftmargin=2em, xrightmargin=0.9em]
$\nproc$ P: (k: Int), (rng: [Bit]), (sid: someSID), 
  ($\$$p2m: PM), ($\$$p2a: PQ) |- ($\$$ch: 1) = {
  $\nmatch$ $\$$p2m, $\$$p2q (
    $\tg{-- work with the channels}$
  )
}
\end{lstlisting}


%\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\scriptsize\BeraMonottFamily, mathescape, frame=single, numbers=left, xleftmargin=2em, xrightmargin=0.9em]
%$\nproc$ main{n}: (k: Int), (rng: [Bit]), (sid: someSID) |- ($\$$ch: 1) =
%{
%    $\$$pq2p, $\$$qp2q $\leftarrow$ providerless[q2p,p2q,qandp]{q2pn,p2qn} $\leftarrow$ k rng sid
%    
%    $\$$2mep, $\$$2p $\leftarrow$ providerless[m2p,p2m,mandp]{m2pn,p2mn} $\leftarrow$ k rng sid
%    $\$$pch $\leftarrow$ P $\leftarrow$ k rng sid $\$$2p $\$$pq2p
%    $\$$2meq, $\$$2a $\leftarrow$ providerless[m2q,q2m,mandq]{m2qn,q2mn} $\leftarrow$ k rng sid
%    $\$$qch $\leftarrow$ Q $\leftarrow$ k rng sid $\$$2p $\$$qp2q
%    $\$$ch $\leftarrow$ main{n} $\leftarrow$ k rng sid 
%}
%\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Design Constraing on Import}
Shared session types are less constrained in how they are used, but we use them sparingly because they constrain execution to the session types they use.
In NomosUC, we limit their type parameters to functional messages only, because allowing channels to be sent over communicators would enable behavior that is not compatbile with the ITM model of UC~\footnote{The UC experiment defines a control functiona that restricts what other ITMs a specific machine can send messages to. Allowing channels to be sent over channels would allow a process configuration to break the rules, because channels don't contain identity information of the caller. The environment might directly send messages to the ideal functionality.}.
Further, the communicator type allows only a constant amount of import to be sent with every message. In our channels, each direction of communication carries its own constant amount of import.
When defining processes, the programmer must be aware of this constraint and set the import amounts in their session types to ensure that a process has enough import to do what it needs. 
In general, we recommend that definitions intended to be generic, or reusable, are parameteric in the amount of import they take. 
For example, enforcing a specific amount of import for \Fcom to accept, limits the protocols that can realize it to ones that only require that much import.

\todo{Review the appendix}
We refer the reader to Appendix~\ref{app:itm} for an example of what the generated code for a providerless channel looks like for our running commitment example, an example of a cyclic topology of processes and how it is realized by providerless channels, and an argument of why we can use this construction to realized any arbitrary ITM topology as a process configuration.

%
%A limitation of binary session types is the communication topologies that they can realize.
%When a linear channel is created, it is offered by a process called the ``provider'' and given to a process called the ``client'', and impose a strict parent-child relationship between processes.
%The process configuration in Figure~\ref{fig:pandq} is not realizable, because of the circular dependency. 
%$P$ must be spawned by $Q$, giving $Q$ its channel, and $Q$ must be spawned by $P$ in order to give it its channel.
%We overcome this limitation by using shared session types to create a new abstract channel called a \emph{providerless channel}.
%Shared channels allow us to define a message buffer called a communictor, that lets multiple other processes use its channel and use it to send messages.
%The communicator can be thought of as a message buffer, and any process can attempt to \emph{acquire} its channel, check for new messages with \mb{poll}, and place another message in the bugger with \m{push}(similar to shared memory accessed via a lock).

%We provide the full typing rule of shared session types and the communicator in the Appendix.
%
%Communicators introduce some constraints. 
%First its session type is simple and only allows adding a messages and polling for a new message.
%This means that messages sent over it are functionally typed and enforce no message ordering of their own.
%Second, only a constant amount of import can be sent through the communicator because it only has one possible label, $\mb{push}$.
%We overcome these limitations, for the type system and for the programmer's experience, through the abstract channel shown in Figure~\ref{fig:newpandq}.
%Rather than $P$ and $Q$ offering each other their channels, new dummy processes are created ($a_p, b_p, a_q, b_q$) that offer both $P$ and $Q$ the session types that they expect, \m{PtoQ} and \m{QtoP}.
%These process communicate and translate messages from $C$ to the corresponding label on on the channels they offer, and vice verssa.
%The triviality of these dummy processes, means their code can be easily generated as one long case statement.
%\emph{The programmer need only specify the session type, the functional message type, and a mapping between them.}

%The new constructors $\up$ and $\down$ indicate an acquire-release paradigm to prevent non-determinism, along with the write token, when both $P$ or $Q$ attempt to write.
%A sender $P$ acquires the communicator's channel, $\#c$, and $\mb{push}$es a functionally 
%typed message along with some import $\textcolor{red}{\getpot^n}$.
%The receiver $Q$ waits for $\#c$ to be released and asks for a new message with $\mb{poll}$. 
%If a new message was written, $Q$ receives label $\mb{yes}$ on $\#c$, the message, and the import.
%Otherwise the channel takes the $\mb{no}$ branch.

%\plan{Right here was a more in depth about providerless channel constructions and how the different processes are spawned, but we move that to the appendix. Describing it here concisely only makes it more confusing rather than less. In the appendix they can be presented with a full descriptive example of a cycle of three ITMs.}
%Communicators alone, however, would constraint all processes in NomosUC to communicate through the same type $\m{comm[m]\{n\}}$, negating the descriptive session types we want from using session types.
%
%We abstract channels into \emph{providerless channels}: a channel implemented by a communicator and some dummy processes whose code is generated at compile-time.
%In Figure~\ref{fig:newpandq}, we show an illustration of a providerless channel. The dummy processes $a_P$ and $b_P$ offer the linear session types that $P$ expects and communicates with $Q$ through the communicator.
%Process $a_P$ case matches on the labels in type \m{PtoQ} and sends the analogous, functionally-typed $\tau_{\m{PtoQ}}$ message to the communicator, and vice-versa for receiving from \m{C}.
%For example for \Fdb and a party (in relation to Figure~\ref{fig:newpandq}), $\m{QtoP} := \m{db}[k][v]$ and $\tau_\m{QtoP} :=$ Store \inline{of PID k v |} OK \inline{of PID |} Get \inline{of PID k |} Yes \inline{of v |} No.
%
%Spawning the processes in a providerless channel must be done in a specific order given the linearity of the channels that $a_P$ and $b_P$ offer. 
%The communicator, $C$, is spawned first. The party $P$ must be a client of $a_P$ and $b_P$ and, therefore, its initialization code spawns them first, gives them the shared  $\#c$, and begins communication.  
%In general, every process using providerless channels must have initialization code like this. 
%The intitialization is trivial and the dummy processes simple case statements.
%\emph{Therefore, generating their code at compile-time given the only the relevant types relieves a big burden on the programmer.}
%We given an example of a NomosUC process, it's session types, and show what $a_P$, $b_P$, and the wrapped process look like in Appendix~\ref{app:expand}.
%In Appendix~\ref{app:itm} we use prodiverless channels to show that \emph{NomosUC processes can realize any ITM system and vice versa (NomoUC $C' \Leftrightarrow$ ITMs $M'$)}.

%A important consequence of providerless channels is that the session type of communicators accepts a \emph{constant} amount of import on every message.
%It means that in addition to specifying $\tau_\m{PtoQ}$ the user must also specify the constant import parameter given to the providerless channel.
%For example for a session type with two labels, one sending $n$ import and one $m$, the communicator in the providerless channel is parameterized with \emph{at least} $max(n,m)$ import to ensure sufficient runtime.
%In general, this doesn't restrict what NomosUC can realize but does mean the programmer must take care when setting import values for protocols and functionalities.
%Fortunately, this doesn't affect the Theorems we prove in this section as they are agnostic of the types of the processes they use.
%Furthermore, precise runtime constraints or reasoning about efficient algorithms is not an intended goal of UC, and functionality and protocol code are still written according to the more descriptive session types they use.

%\paragraph{\textbf{Dynamic Parties and Functionalities}}
\subsection{Dynamic Parties and Functionalities}
One of our main contributions is performing execution cost analysis while allowing dynamic creation of protocol parties and ideal functionalities.
The key design challenge in realizing this feature, the topographies allowed by linear channels, is resolved by providerless channels.
We enable th arbitrary number of parties by introducing a new construcat called the \partywrapper, \MX, that internally runs and manages the creation and execution of protocol parties.
Our virtualization allows us to perform this action in a polytime way, while taking advantages of the descriptive nature of import session types.
We introduce a similar construction for ideal functionalities that creates and spawns an arbitrary number of instances for $!\F$.

When another main party, say \Z or \F, sends a message to a particular party with \m{pid}, it sends a generic message to \MX through a channel of type:
\begin{tabbing}
    $\mi{type} \; \m{P2F[\tau]\{n\}} = \ichoice{\textcolor{red}{\paypot{n}} \; \mb{p2f}: \m{PID} \arrow \m{\tau} \arrow \m{P2F[\tau]\{n\}}}$
\end{tabbing}
The \partywrapper reads the message, creates providerless channels parameterized with a virtual token type and creates an instance of the party with \m{pid} with these channels as parameters if it doesn't already exist.
Although the generic type \m{P2F} above doesn't express any specific message ordering, the providerless channel that connects \MX, internally, to party \m{pid}, uses the session type of the protocol party--ensuring the session types are still useful.
For example, \Z sends a message to the sender of \protcom by sending label $\m{P2F[\tau]\{n\}}$ where $\tau$ is the functional type equivalent of the session types \m{sender} and \m{receiver}: \inline{type comp2f = Commit of Bit | Open}.
After spawning the protocol party with its channels, \MX withdraws the necessary import and forwards this message on its providerless channel to the party. 
The endpoint of this channel at the party presents the expected session type.

The generic communication types \m{P2Z} and \m{Z2P} also imply that there is some constant amount of import sent with the single label in each type.
Setting this import is up to the programmer who can define any parameter as the import send from \MX to all other entities as long as \MX always has enough import.
In general, arbitrary import amounts are acceptable as long as they are identical in both worlds, because UC isn't oncerned with precise runtime bounds.

In summation, the \partywrapper is a (de)multiplexer that uses the \m{PID} of the part as the index. 
(De)multiplexing is critical to easily realizing a dynamic number of parties, and providerless channels overcome the limitations of linear channel ownership and the provider-client relationship.

%The protocol/functionality messages above are functionally typed, as in providerless channels, but even so, protocols parties and functionalities are written using their specific session type (due to the internal providerless channels from \MX to a party), and \MX takes care of the rest. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\rmd{A text snippet of the party wrapper}
%On a message from \Z, for example, \MX creates parties with:
%\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\footnotesize\BeraMonottFamily, numbers=left, mathescape, frame=single, xleftmargin=2em, xrightmargin=2em]
%$\nmatch$ $\$$z2p, $\$$f2p, $\$$a2p (
%  Z2P(pid,m),*,* =>
%    $\nget$ {z2pn} K $\$$z2p ;
%    $\nif$ not exists pid $\nthen$
%      $\$$z2p' $\leftarrow$ channel_init[K1][z2p]; 
%      $\tg{... rest of the channels ...}$
%      $\$$c' $\leftarrow$ PS.prot $\leftarrow$ k rng sid 
%               $\$$z2p' $\$$p2z' $\$$f2p' $\$$p2f';
%      $\tg{(* store the channels in lists *)}$
%      lz2p $\leftarrow$ append lz2p (pid, $\$$z2p'); 
%      $\tg{...}$
%    $\nelse$ ()
%    $\$$z2p' $\leftarrow$ search lz2p pid ;
%    $\nwithdraw$ K K1 z2pn
%    $\$$z2p'.Z2P ; $\nsend$ $\$$z2p m; 
%    $\npay$ {z2pn} K1 $\$$z2p' ;
%  *,F2P(pid,m),* => $\tg{(* identical case *)}$
%  *,*,A2P(pid,m) => $\tg{(* identical case *)}$
%)
%\end{lstlisting}
%Parties are created when some \m{PID} receives its first message (lines 4-10). 
%We reference the protocol through a module \inline{PS} in line 7, and, as mentioned above, the providerless channels indicated by \inline{channel_init} and the initialization code for the protocol party are generated and replaced by their constituent processes before being compiled.
%Finally, \MX forwards the message to the sandboxed party by creating virtual tokens and sending on its channel. 
%%The session type that the party uses within \MX still  ensures that protocol ordering and import descriptions are preserved. 
%This design require that the token hierarchy always have at least one virtual token type to enable \MX.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\rmd{comparing partywrapper to bangf}
%Like EasyUC (and EasyCrypt), the \partywrapper acts almost like an addressing interface where messages include the receipient's \inline{PID}.
%We reuse the labelling from Figure~\ref{fig:newpandq}. \todo{check}
%The \partywrapper construction is nearly identical to how we realize $!\F$ and $!\pi$, the multisession extensions of functionalities and parties, respectively. 
%$!\F$ internally runs arbitrarily many instances of \F and multiplexes message to/from them via a subsession ID (ssid) of type \m{SID[a]} where \m{a} is functionality-specific type often used to encode parameters. 
%Instead of $m$, $!\F$ receives $(\m{sid},m)$, using \m{sid} to route the message.
%The code to spawn new functionalities is identical: providerless channels and initialization code around \F.
%Due to the close resemblance, we do not insert the code for $!\F$ here.
%Multisession protocols, $!\pi$, behave as protocol parties within \MX but internally run arbitrary many subsessions pertaining to their specific \m{PID}.
%Later in this section, we realize an important theorem for the multisession operator.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\rmd{no more channels vs tapes}
%\paragraph*{\textbf{On Channels vs Tapes}}
%\todo{This is the passage from the paper: this modeling does not allow representing realistic
%situations where the number and makeup of components changes as the system evolves. It also does
%not capture commonplace situations where the sender has only partial information on the identity
%or code of the recipient. It also doesn’t account for the cost of message addressing and delivery; in
%a dynamically growing systems this complexity may be an important factor. Finally, it does not
%account for dynamic generation of new programs.}
%The UC framework specifically addresses prior models of distributed computation that model communication through names channels, as we do in NomosUC.
%The work suggests that though such a model is clean an elegant it doesn't allow scenarios where a sender may not have complete information about the identity or code of the receiver.
%Furthermore, it doesn't account for situations where the components in a system of ITMs evolves and changes, for example dynamic generation of new programs.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Commitment Example}
\todo{we present the sim earlier to i removed it here}
%The commitment example is the running one use to explain different parts of NomosUC process code and our typing rules. 
%Here we present the simple way in which the protocol and simulator proof are defined. 
%For brevity, we confine our presentation here to the case of the corrupt sender, and relegate the rest of the presentation to the appendix.
%
%Recall that the honest protocol has the sender using \Fro to commit to a bit $b$ by hashing $(b, nonce)$, where $nonce$ is a blinding factor, and sends the hash to the receiver with a \inline{Commit(b)} message.
%The honest protocol for the case of the honest sender is shown in Section~\ref{sec:example} and contains a call to the ideal functionality that lets it send a message with the label \mb{sendmsg}. 
%We augment the standard \Fro to also allow message passing between the two parties.
%Rather than a single channel we split the communication among two channels with the following sessioin type:
%\scalebox{0.9}{
%\parbox{0cm}{
%\begin{tabbing}
%$\m{rop2f[a]{n}} = \ichoice{$\=$\textcolor{red}{\getpot^1} \mb{hash}: \m{pid} \product \m{(Bit,Int)} \ \tensor \m{rop2f[a]{n}},$ \\

%\end{tabbing}
%}}
%
%We define a simulator for \Fcom for the dummy adversary in the real world.
%The dummy adversary suffices for an emulation proof, because it's the strongest possible adversary and there is a deterministic function for adapting a simulator for the dummy adversary to a simulator for any other adversary.
%In the real world with a corrupt sender, \Z observes no messages received from the receiver, and tries to create a commitment and open it to the receiver.
%The ideal world simulator \Sim must ensure that the ideal world opens only if the real world succesfully opens and ensures that the ideal world commits to the same bit as the real world.
%This is done by \Sim by sandboxing \Fro, reading \Z's requests to compute hashes on behalf of the corrupt sender, and peeking at the bit that was committed to.
%
%Like the \partywrapper, \Sim presents a generic interface to \Z where there is no message ordering with a type \m{Z2A[a]\{n\}} and \m{A2Z[a]\{n\}}. 
%Like the real world, messages for \Sim on channels \inline{$\$$z2a} and \inline{$\$$a2z} are indicate messages for \Fro.

%\subsection{The UC Experiment}
%The UC experiment, \m{execUC}, is a process, like any other, that takes in a security parameter $k$, a random bit string $r$ to be used by all other processes, and offers a linear channel of type
%\begin{center}
%\vspace{-2mm}
%\parbox{0cm}{
%\begin{tabbing} 
% $\m{execout}[\K][a]\{n\} = \echoice{ \textcolor{red}{\getpot^{\{n : \K\}}}\mb{exec}: $\=$ \ \ichoice{ \mb{out}: \m{Bit} \product 1}}$ 
% \end{tabbing}}
%\vspace{-2mm}
%\end{center}
%It starts on \mb{exec} with some amount of import $n$ that it gives to \Z, the first process it spawns.
%All \Z in NomosUC offer the same type channel to \m{execUC}:
%\begin{center}
%\vspace{-2mm}
%\parbox{0cm}{
%\begin{tabbing}
% $\m{EtoZ}[a]$ = $\ichoice{\m{SID}[a] \arrow [\m{PID}] \arrow \echoice{\textcolor{red}{\getpot^n} \mb{start}: \m{Bit} \arrow 1}}$
% \end{tabbing}}
%\vspace{-2mm}
%\end{center}
%It selects the session id (along with any protocol-specific parameters, \inline{a}) and the list of corrupt parties ([\m{PID}]).
%\m{execUC} uses these are parameters for initializing \MX, \A, and \F.
%Finally \m{execUC} $\mb{start}$s the environment with all the initial import, waits for its bit output indicating its guess for which world it is in, and forwards that bit \mb{out} on its own channel indicated by the type \m{execout[a]\{n\}} above.
%We can now assert the following about \m{execUC}:
%\textbf{As long as the $n$ given to it (and to \Z) is $poly(k)$, the Theorems \ref{lem:local_ppt} and \ref{thm:global_ppt} ensure the entire execution terminates in $poly(k)$}

%As described in the providerless channels paragraph, \m{execUC} calls a \inline{channel_init} and connects them to wrapped processes such as \inline{wrap_adv}.
%The providerless channel construction replaces these calls, with the generated portions of providerless channels.

%\m{execUC} only spawns processes already wrapped according to the providerless channel specification in Section~\ref{sec:basic}.
%Therefore, it only has to spawn the part of the channel that connects wrapped processes.
%We make this separation because the wrapped processes code is autogenerated given a specification of the session type and functional
%type associated with the process.

%All main processes in NomosUC are wrapped according to the providerless channel specification in Section~\ref{sec:basic}. 
%Therefore, \m{execUC} creates only the part of the providerless channel (e.g. $\m{PtoQ}$ channel from Figure~\ref{fig:newpandq})
%and passes them as input to the communicator wrappers.
%The wrapper creates the intermediate processes and the shared session types providing the linear channel to \m{execUC}.
%For example \Z and \A are connected by the following channels:
%\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\footnotesize\BeraMonottFamily, mathescape]
%$\$$ztoa $\leftarrow$ channel_init[$\tp{G}$][$\tp{z2a}$]{$\tp{z2an}$}
%$\$$atoz $\leftarrow$ channel_init[$\tp{G}$][$\tp{a2z}$]{$\tp{a2zn}$}
%$\tg{...}$
%$\$$z <- env[G] k rng $\$$ztop $\$$ptoz $\$$ztoa $\$$atoz ;
%\end{lstlisting}

%\paragraph*{\textbf{Emulation}}
%The central security definition in UC is indistinguishability between the real and ideal world experiments.
%It is defined in terms of the ensemble of distributions created by the output bits from the partial term
%$(\m{execUC}\ \pi\ \F)$ over all possible random inputs and security parameters. 
%We say that two worlds are indistinguishable if $\forall \A\ \exists \Sim\ \forall Z$
%the \emph{statistical difference} in ensembles from the two worlds is negligible in $k$ (see
%Definition~\ref{def:emulation} below).
%
%\begin{definition}[Emulation]\label{def:emulation}
%If two protocols $(\pi, \F_1)$ and $(\phi, \F_2)$, which we refer to only
%by \PI and $\phi$, emulated each other, then $\forall \A$ of type $\Delta_3'$ well-matched with \PI, there must $\exists \Sim$ of the same type,  well-matched with $\phi$, s.t. $\forall \Z$ : $\msf{execUC}(\pi, \F_1, \Z, \A)$ $\approx$ $\msf{execUC}(\phi, \F_2, \Z, \Sim)$:

%\end{mathpar}
%\end{definition}
%The notation $e \leftrightarrow e'$ is used to denote two \emph{well-matched} process terms meaning
%that they have the \emph{same type on all the channels} used and provided.
%Without a formal logic for security proofs, we rely on session types being well-matched in both executions to ensure some basic form of emulation of import usage and protocol behavior.

% \paragraph*{\textbf{Dummy Lemma}}



% introduce composition and show how providerless channels easily connect two processes
% this should elucidate how connections happen and then the dummy lemma is equivalent just connecting simulators
% 
\subsection{\textbf{Single Composition}}
We illustrate the simpler case of single composition, defined in Theorem~\ref{thm:singlecomp}, and describe the necessary constructions involved in connecting protocols and simulators.
Single composition along with a multisession theorem, which realizes the Theorem~\ref{thm:functor} (we allude to the construction of $!\F$ earlier in this section), can be combined to show in a natural way to show that fulll composition can be realized in NomosUC.

The single composition operators defines a generic way to connect two protocols together to function as a single protocol.
In Theorem~\ref{thm:singlecom}, a protocol $\rho$ that uses functionalitt $F_3$ can instead use protocol $\pi$ that realizes $F_3$ in the $F_2$ hybrid world. 
Instances of the protocol resulting from this composition, $\rho \circ \pi$, is run inside \MX.
Input from \Z is handed to $\rho$ and output from $\rho$ intended for the functionality $\F_3$ is instead given to the corresponding instance of $\pi$ (with the same \m{PID}) as if it were input from \Z.
Similarly, output from $\pi$ is given to $\F_2$ if it is functionality input, and given to $\rho$ as if it was a message from $\F_3$.

Below we illustrate how the single composition opreator is defined in NomosUC.
Functionality output from $\rho$ is converted to environment input to $\pi$ by wrapping it in type \m{Z2A} (line 6). 
Similarly, output from $\pi$ intended for \Z is wrapped to appear as input from the idael functionality, to $\rho$.
Recall that session type labels can't be referred to generically, therefore, we rely on simple code generators here to defined the wrap functions.
They are even simpler than the ones used by providerless channels because they perform an even simpler task.

%Single composition, defined in Theorem~\ref{thm:singlecomp}, shows that protocols remain secure when a single instance of a functionality is replaced with a protocol that realizes it. 
%It is the composition theorem that is also realized by ILC.
%For example, this theorem suffices for a protocol $\rho$ that uses $\Fcom$ and replaces it with $\protcom$. 
%Ensuring security when a protocol uses multiple instances of the commitment, $!\Fcom$, requires an additional multisession theorem, Theorem~\ref{thm:functor}. 
%It and the single composition theorem presented here suffice to realize UC composition theorem.
%It is important to reiterate that we do not aim any mechanization of UC proofs in this work, therefore, our goal is here to demonstrate that proofs can be specified in NomosUC as a means of validating that we can realize the full expressiveness of UC.
%
%The single composition operator shows how easy it is to arbitrarilty connect parties regardless of the session type.
%The composition operator combines a protocol party of $\rho$ and a protocol party of $\pi$ (which realizes $\F_2$) by piping output from $\rho$ to $\pi$ as if it came from \Z. 
%The result of the operator is a new protocol definition that the party wrapper spawns instances of.
%The code of the operator is shown below
\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\footnotesize\BeraMonottFamily, mathescape, frame=single, numbers=left, xleftmargin=2em, xrightmargin=0em]
$\nproc$ compose[K,K1] 
  (k: Int), (rng: [Bit]), (sid: SID[s]), (pid: PID), ($\$$z2ro: z2roS), 
  ($\$$ro2z: ro2zS), ($\$$pi2f: pi2fS), ($\$$f2pi: f2piS) |- ($\$$cmp: 1) = {
    $\$$r2p4r, $\$$r2p4p <- channel_init[ro2fS][r2fF]{r2fn}
    $\$$p2r4r, $\$$p2r4r <- channel_init[f2roS][f2rF]{f2rn}
    $\$$r2pz2p <- wrap_p2f_z2p[K][ro2fS][ro2fF]{r2fn} $\$$r2p4p
    $\$$p2rf2p <- wrap_p2z_f2p[K][f2roS][f2roF]{f2rn} $\$$p2r4r
    $\$$ro <- rho[K] <- k rng sid pid $\$$z2ro $\$$ro2z $\$$r2p4r $\$$p2r4r 
    $\$$pi <- pi[K] <- k rng sid pid $\$$r2p4p $\$$p2r4p $\$$pi2f $\$$f2pi
}
\end{lstlisting}

The operator, like \MX, requires some additional code that is standard practice for any such construct.
The instances of $\rho$ and $\pi$ in the operator above are virtual processes run by this composition process, and two additional processes are defined that read messages on channel \inline{$\$$z2ro} and forward them unaltered but with virtual import tokens as well.
These processes are required to exist in NomosUC, and we defined them for every such generic construct we provide.
\todo{make a statement about the import}

Say a protocol $\rho$ wants is composed with \protcom using the operator above.
In the definition of \protcom, the user must speficy the import amounts in the session type of the commitment, but also specify the import amounts exchanged between \F and \MX.
Recall that these are constant amounts sent with every message, in both directions.
The programmer sets the import for these messages, in this example, to ensure that \Fro has enough import in order to perform polynomial work (a net positive import between \Fro and \MX) and that \MX has enough import to perform the actions taken by both the committer and the receiver.
Similarly, in the real world, the dummy adversary's type, which forwards all messages from \Z to either \MX or \F, must be parameterized with an import amount to ensure all processes have enough import.
We discuss, how this import assignment is determined for this example.
First, we consider that the import used in the session types of the committer and receiver don't need to match directly with the import given from \MX to \F.
In fact, they likely won't match, because both the receiver and sender are sending/receiving different messages intended for \Fro but being sent usint the same two channels between \MX and \Fro.
We restate the commitement session types.
\scalebox{0.9}{
\begin{mathpar}
  \mi{type} \; \m{sender} = \textcolor{red}{\getpot^2} \ichoice{\mb{commit} : \m{bit} \product \ichoice{\textcolor{red}{\getpot^0}\mb{Open} : \one}}
\end{mathpar}
}
\scalebox{0.9}{
\begin{mathpar}
  \mi{type} \; \m{receiver} = \textcolor{red}{\paypot^1} \echoice{\mb{rcommit} \arrow \echoice{\textcolor{red}{\paypot^0}\mb{ropen}: \m{bit} : \one}}
\end{mathpar}
}
\scalebox{0.9}{
\begin{mathpar}
  \mi{type} \; \m{adv} = \echoice{\mb{acommit}: \ichoice{\mb{ok}: \one}}
\end{mathpar}
}

A simple assignment for the channels between \MX, \Z, \A, and \F works is as follows.
The channels between \Z and \MX are typed as $\m{Z2P}[\m{comp2f}]\{3\}$ and $\m{P2Z}[\m{comf2p}]\{0\}$.
The channels between \MX and \Fro as typed as $\m{P2F}[\m{rop2f}]\{1\}$ and $\m{F2P}[\m{rof2p}]\{0\}$.
The channels between \MX and \A are typed as $\m{A2P}[\m{rop2f}]\{3\}$ and $\m{P2A}[\m{ro2fp}]\{0\}$--obviously matching the type between \Z and the honest parties in \MX.
The channels between \Z and \A are typed as $\m{Z2A}[\m{rop2f}][\m{roa2f}]\{4\}$ and $\m{A2Z}[\m{rof2p}][\m{rof2a}]\{0\}$.
This is also a satisfying assignment for \simcom, in Figure~\ref{fig:simcom}.
It ensures that for every invocation of it from \Z, and its messages out to the corrupt sender or \Fcom, ensure that it always retains sufficient to emulate \Fro internally.

In the providerless channel model, we illustrate what the internals of the composition look like when a protocol \rhocom is composed with \protcom.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
%\input{figures/compose_diagram}
\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{compose_diagram.png}
\end{center}
\caption{Below is what a protocol $\rho$ that uses \Fcom looks like inside \MX (we only show the case of the sender. Above, is the composed protocol $\rho \circ \protcom$. Below, the part \rhocom connects directly to the \MX internals which relay the message out to \Fcom. Above, \rhocom is directly connected to \protcom via a providerless channel that offers both protocols the appropriate commitment session types. \protcom then connects directly to \MX which outputs its messages to \Fro.}

%\todo{removed the dummy lemma here}
%\begin{theorem}[Dummy Lemma]\label{thm:dummythicclemma}
%If \ $\exists \DS$ s.t. $ \DA, \DS \vdash \F_2 \xrightarrow{\pi} \F_1$ then $\forall \A \ \exists \Sim_\A$ s.t. $\Sim_{\A} \vdash  \F_2 \xrightarrow{\pi} \F_1)$ 
%\end{theorem}
%The dummy lemma is an important result in UC and states that proving emulation w.r.t. a single adversary, the dummy adversary, \DA, is sufficient for emulation.
%The intuition is that \Z can do anything that any \A does by running it internally, and giving its input to \DA.
%The simulator proof for any other \A is a generic simulator constructor that sandboxes \A and \DS and connects them by passing output from \A to \DS.
%It is a straightforward theorem to prove and it useful as validation for the expressiveness of our formulation, and our realization of sandboxing, akin to existing work~\cite{ilc,easyuc,gnuc}.
%Our emulation definition alone ensures that the message and import types align, and our typing rules for virtual tokens ensure that both processes can be correctly simulated. 
%The construction, explained in more detail in Appendix~\ref{sec:dummy}, follows the pattern of the explanatory simulator in Section~\ref{sec:motivate} for routing external message internally with virtual import. The simulator only performs additional work in making inputs from \A to \DS appear as if they are from \Z and vice versa.

%\paragraph*{\textbf{Single Composition}}
%Recalling Theorem~\ref{thm:singlecomp}, the single composition theorem allows replacement of a \emph{single instance} of an ideal functionality $\F_2$ with a protocol $\pi$ that realizes it in the $\F_1$-hybrid world. 
%This is a simpler version of composition (than Theorem~\ref{thm:composition}) that is also realized by ILC, and we use it to realize full composition later.
%The code generation from the providerless channels construction, and the resulting processes introduced earlier in this section make the operator simpler to express.

%The operator is parameterized with a virtual token type, the \m{SID} type $s$, the
%functional message types for the protocols (in \inline{[]}) and their import parameters (in \inline{\{\}}). These correspond to the types that the providerless channels of $\rho$ or $\pi$ use internally.
%The session types that \inline{compose} uses (as a protocol) are the same generic types \MX uses to communicate with \Z, \F, or \A.
%Like \MX it runs the parties internally with virtual providerless channels (lines 9-10) that offer the appropriate session types to $\rho$ and $\pi$, and it routes messages from \MX internally to the channels of $\rho$ and $\pi$ (function \inline{compose_virtualize} on line 22).
%In this way, its session types makes it easy to use, it reuses the generated providerless channels from the two protocols, and the real session typed channels for the two protocols exist in a sandbox within the \inline{compose} operator process (which itself is in a sandbox inside \MX).
%Finally, the channels on lines 12-15 connect $\rho$ and $\pi$ together via providerless channels (as $\rho$ would with \F) with \inline{wrap} processes making output from $\rho$ appear as input from $\Z$, to $\pi$ (and vice versa).
%The emulation definition, but mainly the providerless channels construction, ensures that the import amounts and messages types align between $\rho$ and $\pi$ and between \MX and \Z/$\F_1$.

%The operator interacts with the wrapped versions of the constituent protocols $\rho$ and $\pi$, and its parametric type ensures that even multisession versions of a protocol $\pi$ can be composed with $\rho$.
%It creates channels between the two parties and wraps the message sent from $\rho$ to appear as input from \Z to $\pi$. 
%
%In the next section we talk briefly about building a zero-knowledge UC experient by applying the multisession extension of $!\Fcom$ used throughout this work.
%We talk about it at a high-level and relegate a more detailed specification of the protocol in the appendix.

\paragraph{Simulator for Single Composition}
The corresponding simulator for 
Proving UC security under composition requires creating a simulator for $\rho \circ \pi$ that realizes $\F_3$ in Theorem~\ref{thm:singlecomp}. 
This is done by connecting the two simulators, \SIM{\pi} and \SIM{\rho}, in the same way as the Dummy Lemma: sandboxed \SIM{\pi} receives input from \Z, gives output to \SIM{\rho} which gives output to the ideal world.  
Also like the Dummy Lemma, the simulator construction provided in Appendix~\ref{app:simcomp} is agnostic to the types of the composed protocols and can be easily specified thanks to our token hierarchy. 

% \paragraph*{\textbf{UC Composition}}
\paragraph*{\textbf{Parallel Composition}}
The multisession operator $!$ when applied to a functionality ($!\F$) or protocol ($!\pi$), allows for the creation of arbitrary many instances of the \F or $\pi$ as described earlier.
%Messages from a protocol to $!\F$ include an additional user-defined session id that distinguishes different instances. 
The associated theorem, Theorem~\ref{thm:functor}, is another constrained composition theorem (also realized in SymbolicUC~\cite{symbolicuc} and GNUC~\cite{gnuc}).
It states that multiple concurrently running instances of $(\pi, F_1)$, run as $!\pi$ and $!\F_1$, can UC realize $!\F_2$. The intuition is basic: the instances of $(\pi,\F_1)$ do not share any state 
with each other, therefore, simulating $!\F_2$ boils down to running many concurrent simulators in the ideal world. 
In other words, the simulator for this theorem is simply $!\Sim_\pi$, and its construction is identical to \MX (and $!\F$/$!\pi$) above except the \inline{PID} is replaced by \inline{SID[a]}.

%\end{theorem}
The last, intermediate theorem we use is called the squash theorem which states: $!!\F \xrightarrow{\msf{squash}} !\F$. Simply put, the \m{squash} protocol squashes two layers of multisession, $(\m{sid}_2, (\m{sid}_2, m))$, into a single $(\m{sid}_2 \times \m{sid}_1, m)$. 
This is the simplest theorem stated so far and its simulator, that only demultiplexes \m{sid}s for $!!\F$ needs no explanation.
We use Theorem~\ref{thm:functor}, whose simulator is found in Appendix~\ref{app:ms} and Theorem~\ref{thm:squash}
to show that the UC composition Theorem~\ref{thm:composition} holds below.

%\end{theorem}

Using the simpler composition theorems above, we can show that a simulator proof for full composition (Theorem~\ref{thm:composition}) can be easily constructed using the proofs of Theorems~\ref{thm:singlecomp}, \ref{thm:functor}, and \ref{thm:squash}.
\begin{proof}
The two preconditions of this theorem imply two simulators: $\Sim_{\pi}$ and $\Sim_{\rho}$.
By applying Theorem~\ref{thm:functor} to the first precondition, we have $!!\F_1 \xrightarrow{!\pi} !\F_2$ with simulator $!\Sim_\pi$. 
The next precondition implies $!!\F_1 \xrightarrow{\rho \circ !\pi} !\F_3$, by replacing $!\F_2$ with $(!\pi, !!\F_1)$ resulting in simulator $!\Sim_\pi \circ \Sim_\rho$ (by Theorem~\ref{thm:singlecomp}).
We can squash the double $!!\F_1$ into $!\F_1$ by composing \m{squash} with $\rho \circ !\pi$ resulting in $!\F_1 \xrightarrow{\rho \circ !\pi \circ \m{squash}} \F_2$ (by Theorem~\ref{thm:squash}).
This final form, the composition we desire, has simulator $\Sim_\m{squash} \circ (!\Sim_\pi \circ \Sim_\rho)$ where $\circ$ for simulators means connecting them in the natural way as in Theorems~\ref{thm:singlecomp}.
