There are a few immediate next steps that can be taked to improve the consruction in this work.
Namely, we introduce the notion of providerless channels to generalize communication between two process due to the consraints provider/client relationship and the linearity of channels.
We would like to do away with this requiement for channels and subsequent work would aim to greatly simplify our construction. \todo{I believe the term is `multi-party session types` that refer to non-linear channels that don't need acquire/release?}.

We also point out that we build NomosUC on top of the type system defined by Nomos and retrofit the import mechanism to the existng potential mechanism through our virtual tokens construction.
A drawback of this approach is that have not yet implemented a type checker for NomosUC and rely on manual type checking of our code. A clear next step would be the first examine the feasibility of such a type checker and explore efficient implementations of it.

A few related works to our own, also provide automated proof generation albeit for a more consrained version of the UC framework. Our work provides tooling to specify and analyze UC definitions, however, a goal of future work is to introduce further tools like fuzz testing to provide automated guarantees for the correctness of NomosUC code.
