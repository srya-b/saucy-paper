The primary next step coming from this work is clear.
We would like to remove the provider/client constraints from linear session types while preserving the potential mechanism from resource-aware session types.
This would allow us to get rid of the providerless channel design and directly connect all processes with single linear session types allowing us to realize arbitrary
ITM communication without worrying about cyclic topologies.

We also want to expand our encoding of UC in NomosUC by expressing synchronous and asyncronous models of communication and computation. 
Specifically, creating programming conventions and models around the NomosUC to express such models.
Furthermore, we want to add better tooling around our UC definitions such as automated property-based or model-based testing of functionality/protcol specifications and fuzz testing. 
Tooling like this around NomosUC makes a strong case for it as a practical language for implementing cryptographic/distributed protocols.
