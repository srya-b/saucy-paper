In this section, we analyze the simple, yet subtle, coin flipping primitive
within our framework.  Coin flipping is used throughout cryptographic and
distributed protocols, and we present variants of a commitment-based protocol
that attempts to realize the ideal coin functionality $F_\m{coin}$.  Many coin
flips are then composed together to implement a lottery protocol.  Unlike the
protocols most commonly used in distributed systems, flipping a coin between
two parties or taking part in a distributed lottery require additional
properties of fairness and some limitation on adversarial influence in biasing
the output. Protocols like these are representatives of the constructions used
often in blockchain systems where financial incentives are closely tied to
outcomes.  Our implementation and analysis of these two protocols (and their
composition) in this section highlight's our framework's ability to reason
about these properties in a way that most prior work can not do.  \todo{add
citations}.  Successfully testing for bugs that manifest as distinguishing
environments in a composed protocol demonstrates that key features of the UC
framework remain useful for protocol analysis in an implementation setting.
Zooming out, studying composed protocols is important as the vision of UC as a
development framework relies on the ability of developers to find bugs in, and
analyze, protocols that replace ideal functionalities with software packages
implemented by others.  As protocols become more complex, programmer code will
rely more heavily on existing software and will therefore rely more on their
ability to safely replace ideal functionalities in settings perhaps not
imagined by their authors.  We begin by defining the ideal 2-party coin flip,
$\F_\m{coin}$, and create a lottery using multiple instances of it.

Implementing a coin flipping protocol is more difficult than it seems, and the
subtle ways the protocol can fail serve as a good exampple to study.  The
example highlights the need for a framework for distributed applications that
can offer a generalized approach to testing and analyzing even these protocols.
We present the analysis by first implementing $\F_\m{coin}$ in the most natural
way using bit commitment, and show its failures discovered by our fuzzing
method.  Then we iteratively build upon the simple protocol trying to patch
each new failure detected, in the simplest way. We aim to make the point that
the UC framework is especially necessary in such cases where bugs are
non-intuive at design and failures can occur in a probabilistic way are a resul
of byzantine behavior. Finally, at the end of the section we discuss checking
similar properties in the context of more complex, higher-level protocols like
the ABA protocol described earlier.

\subsection{Lotteries from Coin Flips}
The ideal 2-party coin flip, $\F_\m{coin}$ in Figure~\ref{fig:fcoin}, requires
both parties to initiate the toss and eventually outputs the result of the coin
flip to both of them.  The latter step captures a ``fairness'' property,
because our asynchronous implementation guarantees eventual delivery to either
both parties or neither of them.  The ideal functionality also gives the
adversary (one party is corrupt) no additional information about the honest
party's input that it can use to choose an input that will bias the outcome.

\begin{figure}

\input{figures/f_flip_fair}
\caption{A fair coin clip where the result is asynchronously delivered to each party.}
\label{fig:fcoin}
\end{figure}

Coin flipping can be though of as a very specific case of distributed
randomness generation.  Such protocols define corruption thresholds, and
similarly require a protocol has limited bias in the outcome regardless of the
actions of computationally bound adversaries.  These protocols are heavily
relied upon in the blockchain domain~\cite{ran, dao}, and we intend to lay the
groupwork here for eventually using UC to analyze more complicated protocols.

\paragraph{A Lottery from Coin Tossing}
A fair lottery is a protocol betweeen $n$ parties that ensures that the
probability of any user winning is $\frac{1}{n}$ and that a winner is
eventually decided. A lottery is a practical example of a protocol, which
relies on generating randomness (in this case with a coin) and, in contrast to
protocols like ABA, cares about the distribution of the output over repeated
runs.  Our lottery protocol is constructed by running many instances of \Fcoin
which are collectively represented by $!\Fcoin$ in UC terminology, until a
single winner remains.


Before explaining the protocol, we note that our protocol design takes some
liberties in the definition of the lottery, for simplicity, by using the
environment to inform other parties of the results of others' flips.
Communication between parties would add layers to the design that require
broadcast primitives, and the added complexity, while not a hurdle to checking
the distributed protocol as evidenced by our previous case studies, is an
unecessary distraction from the point we're emphasizing.  The behavior of ideal
lottery functionality $\F_\m{lotto}$ is given in Figure~\ref{fig:flotto}.  The
functionality requires that the environment gives input to every party in every
round--eliminating half of the remaining participants.  This continues until a
final winner is chosen, at which point $\F_\m{lotto}$ output. Note that
fairness doesn't have a strong meaning in this sense as only the winner ever
outputs anything.  In addition, the protocol assumes that the adversary can
corrupt up to $\frac{n}{2}$ parties and every coin flip has at least one honest
party (a requirement of the corruption model of \Fcoin~\footnote{A coin flip
between two corrupt parties is meaningless because the adversary gets to choose
the result.}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\input{figures/f_lottery}
\caption{The lottery ideal functionality.}
\label{fig:flotto}
\end{figure}

In the real world protocol, all the parties are activated with the
configuration of the current round, and they each initiate and complete their
pair-wise flips through unique instances of \Fcoin using unique session ids
with $!\Fcoin$.  The parties execute the protocol then wait for another input
from \Z for the next round, and repeat this process until the final flip is
completed and the winner is known.  The winning party knows it is the winner
and outputs to \Z. At a superficial level, the interface offerd by this
protocol is identical to $\F_\m{lotto}$.

We define a simulator for the protocol $\pi_\m{lotto}$ to realize
$\F_\m{lotto}$ in the natural way given a full-information protocol.  Then we
check our implementation with the following real-ideal experiment $!\Fcoin
\xrightarrow{\pi_\m{lotto}} \F_\m{lotto}$ through our fuzzer and fix
implementation bugs until we are assured that the lottery was correctly
implemented. The construction provided is theoretically sound and is the basis
for checking the composed protocol where \Fcoin is replaced by a real protocol. 

\subsection{Composing With a Real Coin Flip}
It is important to underscore that even simple real-world protocols like coin
flips are subtle, minor design choices can cause them to fail, and a framework
capable of discovering failures in such protocols is a necessity.  We start by
replacing \Fcoin, in the above construction, with the simplest coin flip
protocol based on bit commitment, check it, and iterate on its design patching
bugs and failures that our fuzzer discovers.
% TODO: point out in the intro that the lottery is a small and contrived example, and the examples with variations of the shared coin in ABA are more representative and worthwhile analyses
% TODO: but highlight that even this is something other works can't reason about or automatically check
To the untrained eye, the failures we encounter as a result of our coin flip
protocols aren't immediately clear from the protocol description and are
non-intuitive.  Therefore, a generalized approach to finding them by relying
solely on the single property of real-ideal indistinguishability is one of the
big advantages of developing with UC.  Intuitivel, checling output
distributions requires observing the output of the protocol across many runs
and many different possible inputs and adversaries.

The coin flip protocol proceeds as follows. We use the well-known bit
commitment in the random oracle, represented by the ideal functionality
$\F_\m{com}$, model for simplicity  elide its precise definition
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The first party activated by \Z, the \emph{flipper} $S$, commits to a
        bit $b$ with a blinding factor $r \xleftarrow{\$} \{0,1\}^*$ and sends it
        to $R$.  
    \item $R$ receives the commitment, flips its own random bit $b'$, and sends
        it to $S$.
    \item $S$ waits for $b'$ and then opens the commitment to $R$.
    \item $R$ learns $b$ from the opening, checks the commitment, and both
        parties compute and output $flip = b \oplus b'$.
\end{enumerate}
Bit commitment ensures that $S$ must choose its bit before knowing $R$'s bit,
$S$ can't equivocate on its choice of $b$ and $r$, and that $R$ doesn't learn
$b$ before it's opened. Under these two properties, a corrupt $R$ can't choose
$b'$ to bias the output.

We test this protocol under composition for the following relationship:
$$\m{execUC} \; \Z \, \A, \pi_\m{lotto} \circ \pi_\m{coin} \, !\F_\m{com} \, \sim$$ 
$$\m{execUC} \; \Z \, (\Sim := \Sim_\m{coin}) \, \pi_\m{lotto} \, !\F_\m{coin}$$.
Our fuzzer immediately finds a distinguishing environment for this protocol
that results in a \emph{liveness failure} caused by a \emph{fairness} bug in
the real-world protocol. As it turns out, there is an information asymmetry in
the protocol where the byzantine committing party always learns the output of
the flip (it knows $R$'s $b'$ and its own $b$) first, and it can refuse to ever
open its commitment if it doesn't like the outcome. Notice, importantly,
prohibiting information assymetry is difficult to express as a standalone
property without the presence of a framework that allows such definitions. This
failure highlights the advantages of specifying protocols in the expressive
ideal functionality model.

The knee-jerk reaction of requiring both parties to commit to a bit (to get
blinding) clearly doesn't solve the failure.

\paragraph{Iteration: Security with Abort}
Instead, we fix this protocol by allowing a party to leave the protocol as long
as it does so explicitly by sending a abort message.  It sends the honest party
an \m{abort} message (a standard practice in UC literature~\cite{common, abort,
defs} and one that is enforceable in a system where financial incentives are at
play).  Th new protocol adds a step between 3 and 4 (above) where party $R$
waits for the commitment opening or an abort message from $S$.  On \m{abort},
the honest $R$ locally computes a coin flip $c \xleftarrow{\$} \{0,1\}$ and
outputs it as the result of the protocol, thus ensuring that honest parties
always output a result and its output is generated randomly.  Performing the
same experiment again, with an adapted simulator $\Sim'_\m{coin}$, our fuzzer
no longer finds a liveness error but now asserts another failure.  Despite
solving the issue of fairness, the new protocol now fails the other desired
property: a uniform output distribution in every case where $S$ aborts the
protocols despite the local coin flip over many runs of the protocol.  It is a
non-obvious failure, but careful study of the protocol confirms the bug.
Imagine $S$ has preference $c$ and aborts whenever $b \oplus b' = \neg c$.  The
additional local flip by $R$ means it takes two coin flips to output $\neg c$
for it to be the output, and only 1 (between $S$ and $R$) for $c$.  Therefore,
$P(c) = \frac{1}{4}$ and $P(\neg c) = \frac{3}{4}$.  This failure propagated up
to the lottery protocol where the fuzzer observed the $P(p_i \text{ winner})
\neq \frac{1}{n}$.
% NOTE: failures can be anything but k corrupt means we tolerate k/n prob the adv wins

\paragraph{Iteration: Tune Bias}
The above cases suggest that the information assymetry cannot be overcome
without additional primitives like an atomic swap for information.
Specifically, bias is inevitable in this setting, and this is in fact confirmed
by a wealth of existing literature~\cite{cleve1986limits, moran2016optimally}.
Rather try to overcome the bias, we modify the lottery definition to reflect
the available, and use our fuzzer to analyze the protocol withe different
parameters for the adversary's probability of winning.  We propose a new
2-party coin flip protocol that allows the adverasry to win with bias $1/2$ and
run the previous experiment with this new $\F_\m{biased}$ and the
flip-with-abort protocol.  In this new regime, $\pi_\m{lottery}$ in the
$\F_\m{biased}$ world is executed against $\pi_\m{lotto}$ in the
$\pi_\m{abortcoin}$ where $\pi_\m{lotto}$ is the real lottery protocol and
$\pi_\m{abortcoin}$ is the coin flip with abort protocol described above.  We
run this through our fuzz tester, and importantly aren't looking for a specific
property or probability with which an honest party wins the lottery, but are
only looking whehter the distributionsa re identical.  The probability
calculation for the lottery with coin-with-abort protocol is non-trivial, so we
rely on knowing only the probabilities for the coin flip and ensuring the two
worlds output the same distribution--whatever that might be.


%From the above, it's clear that there is always an information assymetry in the
%2-party setting unless the network can ensure a fair exchange between the two
%parties.  In fact, this result is well known in literature where any $r$-round
%coin flipping protocol allows the adversary to bias the output of the honest
%party by $\Omega(1/r)$~\cite{cleve1986limits, moran2016optimally}.  Rather than
%try to construct a perfect lottery, what if we try to achieve the minimal bias
%we can with the primitives we have.  Modify the parameters of the lottery to
%allow one corrupt party and use the coin flip with abort to choose the winner.
%In this situation, the adverasry should win the games with probability
%$(3/4)^{\log n}$ because he must win $\log n$ flips with probability $3/4$
%each.  We can run this through our fuzzer and check that as the number of tests
%increase with $n=16$ our fuzzer outputs adverasary winning $\approx 32 \%$ of
%the time.

% the adversary wins if log(n) games with 3/4 chance are won: (3/4) ^ log(n) 
% for n=16 an adversary wins with probability (3/4) ^ 4 ~ 0.32 when actually we want 1/n ~ 0.0625
% 1/2 + (1/2)*(1/2) = 3/4

\label{fig:fcoinabort}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{More Complex Protocols}
As a side quest, we perform similar analysis across composition on a more complex protocol that relies on the randomness generated by coin flipping for safety and performance.
The ABA protocol from earlier doesn't target some output distribution, but has an implicit output distribution based on the distribution of the input.
Nevertheless, we can still use the composition experiment to detect failures in the underlying common coin primitive that cause its distribution to change.
We run out fuzzer comparing the ABA protocol with a correct common coin to different coin pimritives that don't output with probability $1/2$.
Since ABA doesn't target an output distribution, different distributions of inputs should yield different output distributions. 
For example, runs where all parties get the same inputs should output that same value most of the time.
In cases where the inputs are distributed evenly (even among corrupt parties), we expect the output to be evenly distributed as well.

%As a side quest, perform a similar compositional experiment on the ABA protocol
%where we replace the ideal common coin with a biased on, to check that our
%fuzzer is able to relate the distribution of imputs to the distribution of
%outputs in the real worlds ($\pi_\m{ABA}$ in the $\F_\m{SCC}$ or $\F_\m{BiasSCC}$
%worlds) with the output of the ideal world $\F_\m{ABA}$.  
%The ABA protocol doesn't require the output follow any specific
%distribution, as long as safety and liveness are satisfied, but we are still
%able to compare the effects of distribution bias across different common coin primitives to detect incorrect realizations of the ABA protocol.  As
%expected, our fuzzer is able to distinguish between the two worlds.

\plan{TODO: concluding paragraph}

%The lottery protocol described by the ideal functionality $\F_\m{lotto}$ in Figure~\ref{fig:flotto} has the environment provide the protocol with full information about the pair-wise coin flips and the winners.
%This deviates from a typical lottery ideal functionality where such information is determined within the protocol, between the protocol parties, but we simplify it to remove unnecessary communication complexity. 
%$\F_\m{lotto}$ also permits a single byzantine party in the set. 
%More byzantine parties can be permitted, but if the adversary wins it doesn't matter which party wins.
%A $\frac{1}{3}$ dishonest set can also be considered without changing the results because $\F_\m{coin}$ ensures the coin flip is unbiased.
%
%The lottery protocol proceeds as follows. 
%The $n$ parties in the protocol are informed about the pair-wise coin flips they will be participating in.
%Once the first round of coin flips finishes, the environment learns the winners of each coin flip and again gives input for the new pair-wise coin flips.
%This continues until the final coin flip at which point the winning party outputs that they have won the lottery.

%The financial incentives involved in the protocol require development frameworks that can express and analyze these properties.
%Importantly, modular design by relying on software packages is necessary, and UC allows the abstraction to be represented by ideal functionalities.
%In the same way that theoretical definitionsr rely on ideal functionalities for assumptions such as authenticated communication, implementation with ideal functionalities is an important feature.
%Simply allowing design in this way isn't meaningful without the ability to analyze protocols across composition and the replacement of ideal functionalities with protocols that attempt to realize them.
%So far we can apply analysis techniques to prove emulation, but doing so across composition remains to be validated.
%\todo{iron out the right lottery protocol}

%UC tells us that we can compose and arbitrary number of instances of \Fflip in order to realize a lottery.
%At a high level, our protocol \prot{lotto}, flips $\log n$ pair-wise coins in order to choose one of $n$ parties as the winner. 
%\todo{should the lottery property only be that the prob of win is 1/(|honest| + 1)? because we don't care which adverasry wins?}


%\paragraph{The Ideal Coin Flip}
%In Figure~\ref{fig:fcoin} we show the ideal functionality for a coin flip. 
%The coin flip specifies that both parties must initiate the flip, and that the adversary can have no influence on the bias of the output bit.
%Unlike the eventual delivery guarantees we discuss for async protocol, the functionality allows the adversary to decide which of the two parties, if any, receive the result.
%This means that $\F_\m{flip}$ allows protocols that are \emph{not fair}: they do no guarantee that if one party receives output all parties eventually receive the output. 
%\begin{figure}

%\input{figures/f_flip}
%\caption{Ideal coin flip that guarantees $P[0] = P[1] = \frac{1}{2}$ but does not guarantee fairness.}
%\label{fig:fcoin}
%\end{figure}
%\todo{It is a known result that no coin flip protocol with n/2 corruptions is unbiased, what do say about that?}


%The first protocols and primitives we examine are distributed coin flipping. 
%Both as protocols and primitives assumed in other protocols, coin tossing is is an integral part of many distributed byzantine protocols, each relying on slightly different assumptions and fault models. 
%They are a simple functionality, but they express and rely on properties such as output fairness and adversarial influence, that UC is uniquely suitable for expressing and reasoning about.
%In this section, we apply our methods to a lottery protocol built atom a two-party coin tossing primitive, and show that, despite knowledge of the aforementioned bug in the old MMR protocol our methods are capable of giving meaningful feedback to the programmer suggesting a possible liveness error \footnote{Recall we employ informal methods for analyzing the protocols in this work, and, especially for liveness, can suggest possible liveness failures rather than assert them directly without knowledge of a useful predicate on the execution.}.
%
%We focus the work in this section particularly on analyzing coin tossing across layered composition, and do this for three reasons. 
%First, we believe that coin tossing is a strong representative example of the kinds of analysis possible in UC which we want to show can be meaningfully analyzed informally as well.
%Second, the assumed primitives across different dirstributed protocols can vary subtley, and, if not carefully analyzed, can be disastrous for the protocols that use them.
%The most prominent example of this is in the original publication of the well-known byzantine agreement protocol by  Mostefaoui et al.~\cite{mmrog} (referred to as the MMR protocol from here on out).
%A work similar our own ~\cite{byzbymc}, identified a critical liveness bug that arose, because the protocol relied weak common coin that allowed the adversary to see the outcome of the coin in advance of some honest parties rather than the perfect common coin that the protocol actually required in order to terminate. 
%Third, software dependencies in this setting is analgous to layered composition. 
%Software packages are represented by ideal functionaliteis for development, and replaced with the underlying protocol that implements it.
%Testing and identifying failures arising from dependencies that either don't realize the ideal functionality or are subtley different from the assumptions expected by the application is an important capabality for the viability of our proposition in this paper. 
%
%
%\todo{keep or don't keep this, we might have this in an earlier section}
%Simple examples like 2-party computation, desired properties can often be deeply interconncted such that specifying them as a list of satisfiable assertion is difficult. 
%In the simplest case of two parties computing a function, notions of correctness and secrecy are connected, for example, to the choice of function being computed, what an adversary can learn about the other party's inputs before choosing its own, or what distributions do the adversary's input or the protocol's output exhibit. 
%In more complex protocols we desired the analysis of properties that define notions of fairness or input availability.
%Specifying these properties in a laundry list of properties can be cumbersome and error-prone, and the ideal functionality model allows expressing arbitrary properties as a computational unit.
%Rather than proving specific assertions hold, UC defines security in relation to an idealized version that exhibits the desired properties implicitly.
%A coin flipping protocols, references throughout this work, is a core subcomponent of many asynchronous distributed protocols, and is a useful case study for examing our implementation.
%
%\subsection{Flipping Fairness}V
%The first example we study is building a lottery protocol off a two-party coin tossing protocol.
%Protocols like Blum's allow two mutually distrustful parties to flip a coin over the telephone protocol, and ensures an unbiased coin only when the adversary does not prematurely abort the protocol.
%Lottery protocols are more modern uses of coin flipping that highlight the influence adversaries can have in determining the output.
%In most agreement protocols, the value of a coin flip isn't as important as long as all parties observe the same outcome.
%In distributed protocols that operate with financial incentives, the lottery being the simplest example of one, this property becomes critically important. 
%The example presented here \todo{finish}
%%Flipping a coin involving several parties is a common coin protocol: a more complex and still widely used primitive in modern agreement protocols.
%%They are used heavily even in modern agreement protocols that operate under the strong common coin assumption: in some round all parties observe the same coin flip. 
%%This relatively straightforward example protocol exhibits many properties that, traditionally, UC is adept at modelling and analyzing like fairness, input availability, and adversarial influence on outcomes.
%%In this section we use this example to demonstrate that our implementation can express such a protocol, allow for analysis of properties like fairness and input availabiltiy, and detect failrue accross composition. \todo{this last sentence needs some work, maybe mention that we compose with the lottery here?}.
%
%
%
%\subsection{Common Coins}
%Many agreement protocols rely on common coins to introduce shared randomness into protocol to allow protocol parties to make common decisions without adversarial influence.
%Common coins definitions vary in their guarantees of output fairness, corruption threshold, and adversarial influence on the output bit.
%The protocols that use common coins are prone to using them incorrectly, as we see in the case of the original MMR agreement protocol where the common coin assumption was shown in \cite{formalbyz} to be to weak and permitted a liveness fault.
%As we describe in the lottery protocol above, and in mode complex distributed protocol, 
%
%The strongest assumtpion is a perfect common coin
