One of the challenges we had to overcome in using the existing Nomos type system was working the provider-client relationship for linear processes, and the constraints it imposes, into the providerless channels construction.
We are forces to intermediate communication between two processes with multiple channels and communicators. 
One of our main aims for future work is to attempt to do remove this requirement and greatly simplify the UC execution construction.

We also point out that we build NomosUC off the type system define by Nomos, however do not yet implement a type checker for NomosUC. We rely on the typing rules and theorems to validate our approach.
We did, however, write a substantial amount of code for the functionalities, protocols, and simulators in this paper and manually type check it.
Another avenue future work would attempt to implement a the type checker for NomosUC.

Some related works to our own attempt to mechanize proof generation for UC security and other definitions of computational security.
A major direction of research for NomosUC is to add automation that allows for fuzz testing even mechanizing proof generation for our UC definitions.
