Shared session types impose an \emph{acquire-release} discipline on processes; 
a client must acquire the channel offered by a shared process to interact with it
and must release this channel after the interaction.
The corresponding typing rules are
\begin{mathpar}
  \infer[\up L]
  {\Tokens \semi \Psi \semi \wt, \D, (x : \up A_L)
  \entailpot{q}{q'} \eacquire{y}{x} \semi Q :: (z : C)}
  {\Tokens \semi \Psi \semi \D, (y : A_L)
  \entailpot{q}{q'} Q :: (z : C)}
  %
  \and
  %
  \infer[\up R]
  {\Tokens \semi \Psi \semi \D \entailpot{q}{q'}
  \eaccept{y}{x} \semi P :: (x : \up A_L)}
  {\Tokens \semi \Psi \semi \wt, \D \entailpot{q}{q'} P :: (y : A_L)}
\end{mathpar}
The $\up L$ rule describes a client acquiring a shared channel $x$
and obtaining a private linear channel $y$ along which it can communicate
with the corresponding acquired process.
Correspondingly, the $\up R$ rule describes the shared process
accepting the acquire request and creating the fresh linear channel $y$.
The release-detach rules corresponding to the $\down$ type constructor
are exact dual of acquire-accept.
